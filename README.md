Bioinformatics Algorithms Part1
===============================

Algorithms used for solving "CODE CHALLENGE"s of a course named "Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 1)" provided by San 
Diego university on Coursera.org

Coursera Honor Code Attention:
-------------------------------

If you are currently participating in the course, please don not use these codes to solve your CODE CHALLENGE 
assignments. Using codes for that purpose is clearly violation of the Coursera Honor Code and besides, why bother
yourself with a challenge you don't want to learn from?!

This project is started by Reza Moradi. Everybody who has/had participated in the course or is interested in optimizing 
some Bioinformatics-related code is welcomed.

Main Objective:
---------------

Our main goal is to make the codes as efficient as possible. Mostly we know the possible best-case for a code, but sometimes 
we must find out.

Programming Languages:
----------------------

Python 3 is recommended, but your code can be in any language.

* <b>File-name</b> format may be <i>name_xyy</i> where <i>name</i> is what that code is referred to, in the textbook 
(https://stepic.org/course/Bioinformatics-Algorithms-61/syllabus); <i>x</i> is chapter number and <i>yy</i> is section
number of the textbook where the code implementation is mentioned. For example <i>PatternCount()</i> is defined in 
<i>1.2 Hidden Messages in the Replication Origin</i>, so the file-name for the code would be <i>PatternCount_102</i>
