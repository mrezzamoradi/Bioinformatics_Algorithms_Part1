Bioinformatics_Algorithms_Part1
===============================

Algorithms used for solving "CODE CHALLENGE"s of a course named "Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 1)" provided by San Diego university on Coursera.org

Auther:
-------

This project is started by Reza Moradi. Everybody who has/had participated in the course or is interested in optimizing some Bioinformatics-related code is welcomed.

Main Objective:
---------------

Our main goal is to make codes as efficient as possible. Mostly we know the possible best-case for a code, but sometimes we must find out.

Programming Languages:
----------------------

Python 3 is recommended, but your code can be in any language.
