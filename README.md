Bioinformatics Algorithms Part1
===============================

Algorithms used for solving "CODE CHALLENGE"s of a course named "Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 1)" provided by San 
Diego university on Coursera.org

Coursera Honor Code Attention:
-------------------------------

If you are currently participating in the course, please don not use these codes to solve your CODE CHALLENGE 
assignments. Using codes for that purpose is clearly violation of the Coursera Honor Code and besides, why bother
yourself with a challenge you don't want to learn from?!



Main Objective:
---------------

My main goal is to solve the problems and learn python at the same time. Everybody who has/had participated in the course or is interested in optimizing some Bioinformatics-related code is welcomed.


Details:
--------

* <b>File-name</b> format may be <i>_xyy_name</i> where <i>x</i> is chapter number and <i>yy</i> is section
number of the textbook where the code implementation is mentioned; <i>name</i> is what that code is referred to, in 
the textbook (https://stepic.org/course/Bioinformatics-Algorithms-61/syllabus); . For example <i>PatternCount()</i> is 
defined in <i>1.2 Hidden Messages in the Replication Origin</i>, so the file-name for the code would be 
"<i>_102_PatternCount</i>".


* I do not essentially use pseudo codes provided in the textbook to solve the problems.
